# Code Club

I started a small code club at work. It's every two weeks on a Wednesday lunch time.  It's open to everyone in the office, regardless of whether they're already a coder or they've never tried.

People bring along the stuff they're working on, and I set a couple of exercises for people to try if they don't have their own project.

This repo is a collection of my attempts at the exercises from each session.  I have used [Python](https://www.python.org) but other languages are also suitable.

Feel free to look at the exercises and make your own attempts in whatever language you're most comfortable with.
